description: Linux is an OS. It is a key tool in cybersecurity, known for being robust, flexible, and open-source. As an operating system, it manages computer hardware and enables software-hardware communication. Linux comes in different versions called distros.

# Shell

A Linux terminal (shell or command line) is a text-based interface between users and the system kernel. Commands entered here control the system. Think of the shell as a powerful text-based GUI for navigating directories, managing files, and accessing system information.

Terminal Emulators
Terminal emulators let you run text-based programs within a GUI. They can host multiple command-line interfaces (CLI) in one window, serving as a gateway to the shell interpreter. Consider the shell as a server room and the terminal as a reception desk - you communicate with the server room through the reception. Terminal emulation creates this reception desk virtually on your screen. Terminal emulators and multiplexers enhance functionality by allowing split windows, multiple directory access, and separate workspaces. One popular multiplexer is Tmux.

Shell
The Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) is Linux's most common shell and part of GNU. It matches GUI capabilities while offering more ways to interact with programs and automate processes through scripts. Other options include Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish shell.
